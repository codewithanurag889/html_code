The `TRIM()` function in SQL is used to remove specified prefixes or suffixes (or both) from a string. It's often used to clean up or manipulate text data by removing unwanted characters from the beginning, end, or both sides of a string.

Here's the general syntax of the `TRIM()` function:

```sql
TRIM([BOTH | LEADING | TRAILING] [characters] FROM string)
```

- `BOTH` removes the specified characters from both the beginning and the end of the string.
- `LEADING` removes the specified characters from the beginning of the string.
- `TRAILING` removes the specified characters from the end of the string.
- `characters` is the set of characters you want to remove. If not specified, it removes whitespace (spaces, tabs, and line breaks) by default.
- `string` is the input string from which you want to remove characters.

Here are some examples of how you might use the `TRIM()` function:

1. Remove leading and trailing spaces from a string:

```sql
SELECT TRIM(BOTH ' ' FROM '  Hello, World!  ') AS trimmed_string;
```

This would return `'Hello, World!'`.

2. Remove leading zeros from a number stored as a string:

```sql
SELECT TRIM(LEADING '0' FROM '000123') AS trimmed_number;
```

This would return `'123'`.

3. Remove trailing underscores from a string:

```sql
SELECT TRIM(TRAILING '_' FROM 'Data_Structures_') AS trimmed_text;
```

This would return `'Data_Structures'`.

4. Remove leading and trailing spaces by default:

```sql
SELECT TRIM('   Sample Text   ') AS trimmed_text;
```

This would return `'Sample Text'`.
